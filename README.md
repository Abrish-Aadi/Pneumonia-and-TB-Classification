# Pneumonia and TB Predictor

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a machine learning model to predict pneumonia and tuberculosis (TB) based on chest X-ray images. The notebook utilizes the dataset available on Kaggle, which includes chest X-ray images labeled with pneumonia, TB, and other classes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be accessed on Kaggle using the following link: [Chest X-ray - Pneumonia, COVID-19, Tuberculosis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtiptj/chest-xray-pneumoniacovid19tuberculosis). The dataset contains a collection of chest X-ray images with annotations for different respiratory conditions, including pneumonia, COVID-19, and tuberculosis.

## Notebook

The notebook file in this repository, named `Pneumonia_and_TB_Predictor.ipynb`, contains the code and documentation for training and evaluating the machine learning model to predict pneumonia and TB based on chest X-ray images. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Contents

The notebook consists of the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: This section focuses on loading the dataset, examining the structure, and performing any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. Model Building: In this section, a machine learning model is constructed to predict pneumonia and TB from chest X-ray images. Various architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) may be explored to extract features from the images and make predictions.

3. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess its performance in predicting pneumonia and TB from chest X-ray images.

4. Conclusion: The concluding remarks provide a summary of the analysis, highlighting the key findings and insights gained from the model's performance.

## Usage

To run the notebook locally, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Clone this repository and open the `Pneumonia_and_TB_Predictor.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to execute the code cells and interact with the analysis.
